# metatron2
An easy to use discord.py based machine learning bot. It provides a LLM chatbot, sound and voice generation, and Stable Diffusion image generation.

## FEATURES

* LLM Chat
* Stable Diffusion image generation
* Stable Diffusion XL image generation
* Bark audio generation

![metatron2](assets/imagegenexample.png)
![metatron2](assets/imagegenexample2.png)

* Stable Diffusion generation via /imagegen.
* Preliminary SDXL generation via /xl_imagegen. No lora or refiner support yet.
* Supports standard safetensors format models.
* A1111 style prompt weighting and LORA loading.
* Single LORA can be loaded from the selection menu, or multiple can be invoked at once using the standard A1111 prompt syntax
* Reroll, DM, and Delete buttons on gens for ease of interaction.
* TI embedding support
* Configurable banned word list and mandatory negative prompt options for moderation purposes.
* Images can be saved and uploaded in either png or jpg
* Supports toggleable per channel default generation settings

![metatron2](/assets/wordgenexample.png)

* Supports a 7B or 13B llm for configurable vram usage needs. See the usebigllm setting in settings.cfg.
* Can be directly chatted with by tagging it or using /wordgen.
* Negative prompts are also supported via /wordgen
* Can summarize chatroom messages with /summarize
* Keeps a per user history so it can maintain multiple conversations at once.
* Replies can be rerolled.
* History message pairs can be deleted via button or entire user history reset.
* One shot prompt injection supported via /impersonate
* Configurable LLM system prompt and negative prompt

![metatron2](/assets/speakgenexample.png)

* Speech, sound, and music generation via /speakgen
* Can generate noises, emotions etc by enclosing word in []
* Can generate music and singing by enclosing words in â™ª
* Using non-English words or characters will generally lead to that accent
* Can create your own custom voice files and use them. See https://github.com/C0untFloyd/bark-gui for a project which can make metatron2 compatible voices.
* Generated sounds can be saved and uploaded in either mp3 or wav


## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS



### Discord Bot Setup

Go to the Discord Developer portal and create a new bot and generate a token for it. Write this token down or else youll have to generate a new one, it only shows you once.

Go to the Bot tab on the Developer portal site and enable Privileged Gateway Intents. You need Presence, Server Members, and Message Content enabled.

Go to the URL Generator on the OAuth2 tab and select the bot scope. Then select these permissions "Read Messages/View Channels, Send Messages, Manage Messages, Attach Files, Read Message History, Use Slash Commands" then use the link to invite the bot to your server. I may have missed one, if something is missing you can enable it later in server permissions

### Install

Download the repo  or `git clone https://github.com/Meatfucker/metatron2.git`

Install miniconda if you dont already have it. https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html

Next enter the base conda env. On windows miniconda should make a terminal shortcut for conda, on linux run `conda activate`

Go to the metatron2 directory and run the following command, altering it to use the environment file for your platform  `conda env create -f .\environment.yml`  

metatron2 is now fully installed.

### Running The Bot

run `conda activate metatron2`

Your command line prompt should change to say metatron2.

If it has, next youll want to open up settings.cfg.example and defaults/global.cfg.example, read each setting and set it per your config needs, then save them without the .example extension. At a minimum youll need to enter your Discord bot token.

Now is a good time to copy any models, loras, embeddings, etc to the appropriate directories in the metatron2 directory.

Finally, run `python metatron2.py` and wait.

The very first startup will take quite a long time as it downloads ~20GB of models, namely the LLM model and base SD model if you dont have any models in the models directory. Loading the LLM on subsequent loads can take time as well depending on the speed of the storage your huggingface cache is on.

Be aware that having the wordgen, imagegen, and speakgen modules all active at the same time will peak at about 20GB of vram when running a batch size 4 imagegen.

Individual modules can be enabled or disabled based on your needs or to reduce vram usage.

## settings.cfg

settings.cfg provides all of the settings for the bot. If the example file has more than one line with the same first value, that means you can have multiple.
